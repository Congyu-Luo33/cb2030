# Questions and Answers on Principal Component Analysis.

1. Is PCA considered as a kind of linear regression which shows the correlation between two variables?
 > No, not really. However, the principal component will show that the variance of some variables are better described as a liear combination of the variables. That is would be a sign of co-variation of the variables.

1. Could you clarify in which situation of unsupervised learning it is useful to use PCA rather than k-means clustering? Could we combine k-means clustering and PCA in the same analysis to support each other method?

1. How do you calculate the principal component, such as in your example in the video?
  > With PCA?

1. A requirement in Principal Component Analysis is that the individual principal components are linearly independent (and therefore orthogonal to each other). Does this requirement only apply in respect to the initial/first principal component? Otherwise I donâ€™t understand how this method would be applicable for more than 3-dimensional plots.
  > No all Principal components are orthogonal to each other. *N*-dimensional spaces can contain max *N* vectors that are orthogonal to each other.
