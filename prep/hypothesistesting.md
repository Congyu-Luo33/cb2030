## Preparations for lecture on Hypothesis Testing

As a preparation for the Hypothesis Testing convocation, make yourself acquainted with the material below, and subsequently complete any tasks assigned to you in canvas.

1. Watch the [Video Lecture on Hypothesis Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmqmTCu6lg), and its [slides](slides/HypothesisTesting.pdf)
2. Read the chapter 9.1-9.5 in Downey on [hypothesis testing](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html#sec89).  Unfortunately, the book does not give a good definition of a *p* value. The correct definition is ["the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), however, in section 9.1 and 9.13 other definitions are given. Try to convince yourself that you understand why the books definitions are  problematic? See for instance [this wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values)
4. Investigate the jupyter notebook on [Differential expression anlaysis of the TCGA breast cancer set](../nb/testing/readme)  
3. Read previous years [questions and answers}(../qa/testing) on the material
