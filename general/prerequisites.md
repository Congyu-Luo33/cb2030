## Prerequisites for the course

The course reuires some background knowledge:
 * Bioinformatics corresponding to BB2441 Bioinformatics,
 * Programming corresponding to BB1000 Programming in Python
    - If programming is challenging for you, I would recomend you to walk through  the Jake VanderPlas: [Whirlwind Tour of Python]( http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb)  
 * Statistics corresponding to SF1911 Statistics for Bioengineering 6.0 credits
   - If statistics and probability theory is challenging to you, I recommend the  [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/index.html) book, chapter  1-8, which gives a nice background to you. We will use the other chapters of the book in this course.
 * Knowledge of modern omics experiments corresponding to BB2255 Applied Gene Technology
